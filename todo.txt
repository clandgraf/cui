Window/Buffer synchronized Variables


- Saved in state['win/buf'] in both window and buffer

- If window is selected sync window -> buffer
- If buffer is switched
  -> Drop all of windows win/buf variables
  -> Copy all of new buffers win/buf variables to window
- Modifying buffer or window values syncs to the other if buffer is displayed in selected window
- Emacs syncs on deselect from buffer to window (but since all variables are synced when modified)
  but since we sync directly this should not be necessary
